## Problem :

The Covid19 pandemic has taken over the entire world. It has caused millions of deaths and socio economic loss. After months of combined efforts, our scientists have finally developed vaccines against the virus. 

However, now the challenge is to **vaccinate the population**. For any country, vaccinating the entire population quickly, securely and effectively is a tough challenge. We need a well designed solution to address this problem.
