# Team - NEXA

### Track: Data Science and AI

## Problem :

The Covid19 pandemic has taken over the entire world. It has caused millions of deaths and socio economic loss. After months of combined efforts, our scientists have finally developed vaccines against the virus.

However, now the challenge is to **vaccinate the population**. For any country, vaccinating the entire population quickly, securely and effectively is a tough challenge. We need a well designed solution to address this problem.

## Solution :

# VaxU

Here is **Team NEXA** with -

_A complete solution with a personalised app and admin portal, with a special cough based covid testing module, social distancing monitor and KYC verification model, which will make the process convenient, effective and hassle free._

### **Features of VaxU** - _Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning Models_

1. ML - Covid Cough Detection
   - hello
   - hi
2. AI - Adhaar Card Details Validation
   - hello
   - hi
3. AI - Face Recognition
   - hello
   - hi

### **Features of VaxU** - _Web_

1. FrontEnd :
   - The website facilitates only admin portal, It is not for patients or general public.
   - Only authorized doctors and institutions with valid credentials (that will be provided to them by us) can access the admin portal.
   - All data related to vaccinations like cost per vaccine, number of vaccines, availability of doctors etc. can be monitored using the admin portal.
   - Webcam facility is available for the officials to verify the identity of the patient.
   - The officials can monitor the vaccination process through the user friendly UI.
   - The Web Application provides **Crowd Management** feature through time sorted vaccination for the patients i.e. Every patient is alloted specific time slot so as to prevent crowd formation.
2. BackEnd :
   - Proper Authenticated system
   - Two different profiles for patients and authenticated officials are present
   - Time slots are assigned to every patient according to availability, locality and age i.e. people at high risk are given priority.

### **Features of VaxU** - _Mobile Application_

- Statistics of total cases, death, recovery etc. can be viewed at the **Home Screen**
- Local Information related to Covid19 can be viewed at the **City** tab
- Nearby Hospitals can be viewed depending upon the locality and distance in the **Hospitals** tab
- The patient can submit their _Voice Recording_ for our ML model to diagnose if they are suffering from COVID19 or not under the **Check** tab
- Under the **Profile** tab, user can check their personal details, apply for vaccination, ask for helps and logout of the application.
- User can apply for vaccination by filling up the KYC form attaching their own selfies and picture of their Aadhar Card.

### **Tech Stack Used:**

1. ## Machine Learning:
2. Web - Frontend:
   - HTML
   - CSS
   - Bulma Framework
   - JavaScript
   - AOS Library
3. Web - Backend:
   - Django
   - Microsoft Azure Server
   - Celery Beat
4. Mobile Application:
5. Tools:
   - Git
   - GitHub Students Pack

### Business Model / StartUp Potential

- Premium Support:

  All the users with premium support will get prioritized time slots.

- Scalability:

  This project can be extended to facilitate vaccinations for any other future pandemics or diseases.
